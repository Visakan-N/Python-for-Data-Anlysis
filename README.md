Python-for-Data-Anlysis
This repository follows the book Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney (the developer of the pandas library).
In my experience, this is one of the best books to start your Data Science journey and I would recommend this to everyone aspiring to do so.
This book covers the concepts of Data Analysis which is the first step in Data Science.
The most important packages like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc are covered in this book.
